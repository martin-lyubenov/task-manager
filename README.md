Dear viewer, 

This is a simple Task manager made with React and a few React related dependencies ( full list below);

What is can do: 
- Create a new task
- Load all tasks in a list
- Sort task in 3 criteria - All, Active, Completed
- Edit existing tasks (both Active and Completed);
- Delete existing task

Used dependencies: 
- React-Router-Dom
- React-Redux & Reduxjs/toolkit

Things to bear in mind:
- the 'app' is not conneted to a backend so all info is lost on reload. 

Please leave a comment. 

Thank you!
